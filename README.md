So, this project is based on data analysis with the help of Excel. 
In this project I took the help of a dataset which belongs to an imaginary company named AWESOME CHOCLATE. 
After, exmining the data,
I performed some data cleaning and sorting on it so I could get meaningful insights from the data which I also needed for further analysis.
I tried to create this project as the perspective of a business analyst and all the perspectives and approaches that I kept in mind while working on it are mentioned below.

1)  A real-world example data with 10 problems
2) business analytics
3) Step by step analysis on data
4) How to calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, quartiles, range, distinct items & count)
5) Exploratory data analysis in Excel
6) Analysis with formulas vs. pivots (necessary techniques)
7) Top / bottom performing items
8) Anomaly detection
9) Best in class analysis
